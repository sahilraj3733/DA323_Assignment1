Why the anger, why the rage? The blood we shed for you will not be worthy otherwise; For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation. I have been free since the beginning and forever will be so. What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea! I’m like the roaring flood; powerful and independent, I’ll tear apart mountains, exceed all that is known to Man, and still gush out! The lands of the West may be armored with walls of steel, But I have borders guarded by the mighty chest of a believer. Recognize your innate strength! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be killed, By that battered, single-toothed monster you call ? My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men! Render your chest as armor! Stop this disgraceful rush! For soon shall be come the day of promised freedom… Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner! See not the soil you tread on as mere earth, But think about the thousands beneath you that lie without even shrouds. You’re the noble son of a martyr, take shame, hurt not your ancestor! Unhand not, even when you’re promised worlds, this paradise of a homeland. What man would not die for this heavenly piece of land? Martyrs would gush out if you just squeeze the soil! Martyrs! May God take all my loved ones and possessions from me if he will, But may he not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world. O Lord, the sole wish of my heart is that, No infidel’s hand should touch the bosom of my temple. These adhans, the shahadah of which is the base of the religion, Shall sound loud over my eternal homeland. Then my tombstone – if there is one – will a thousand times in ecstasy, O Lord, tears of blood flowing out of my every wound, My corpse will gush out from the earth like a spirit, And then, my head will perhaps rise and reach the heavens. So flap and wave like the dawning sky, oh glorious crescent, So that our every last drop of blood may finally be worthy! Neither you nor my nation shall ever be extinguished! For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag; For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation!",new_image\tr.png,anthems\tr.mp3,1.5

In your emblem, which a rough sea With its wild waves protects, Behind the bare summit of a volcano, A star brightly shines. Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping, Lulled by the resonant song of your seas, When, set in your golden valleys, The bold navigator found you; And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty, And feeling your enchantment, He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem of your splendid mantle. From a country where the sun rises, Beyond the blue Atlantic, That man who had dreamt you In search of you he launched to sea. When you raised your pale forehead, In the lively anxiousness of your hope, Under the gentle dome of your sky Already floated a strange banner. It was useless that your beloved Indian Rushed into the fight with ire, Because, covered with his blood, Lempira, In the deep night he sank; And of the heroic deed, in memory, The legend alone has kept A sepulcher in a forgotten place, And the severe profile of a mountain peak. For three centuries your children heard The imperious mandate of the master; For three centuries your useless complaint In the blue atmosphere was lost But one glorious day your ear Perceived, powerful and distant, That there, far away, over the Atlantic, Indignantly, a lion roared It was France, the free, the heroic, Which in its dreams of centuries slept, Awoke irate to life At the virile protest of Danton: It was France, who sent to the death The head of the consecrated King, And which built up proudly at its side, The altar of the goddess of Reason. You also, oh my country!, arose From your servile deep sleep; You also showed the world The infamous shackle destroyed. And in your blessed soil, behind the tall Hair of the wild jungle, Like a bird of black feathers, The fleeting colony was lost. To guard this sacred emblem We shall march, oh fatherland, to our death; Our death will be honoured If we die thinking of your love. Having defended your holy flag, And shrouded in its glorious folds, Many, Honduras, shall die for you, But shall fall in honour.",new_image\hn.png,anthems\hn.mp3,2.0
