Click here to get started Click here to download your end-of-course certificate About the expertMarion Gibson is the author of The Witches of St Osyth Persecution, Betrayal and Murder in Elizabethan England Cambridge University Press, 2022 Professor Marion Gibson Ive been fascinated by witches and their history for over a quarter of a century. When I first read accounts of witch trials in 16th-century England, I immediately wanted to know more about the accused people often ordinary villagers, poor and illiterate people, women who had little power in their societies. I also wanted to know about their accusers. While some were wealthy and well-connected, others were just as vulnerable as those they accused. I wondered why so many people would be accused of an impossible, magical crime and why some of them confessed they were indeed witches. Why were so many women? Why were they so harshly punished if found guilty? This week, I focus on what witch means, how it was defined and by whom. I also explore what witches were thought to look like and who they might have been in reality. Professor Marion Gibson In this weeks talk I focus on the learned conspiracy theory called demonology, which framed this basic idea of the witch and turned it into a potent driver of witch trials. It was one thing to suspect your neighbour of harming fellow villagers by witchcraft, but what if you thought witches were working together to harm humanity itself, across whole continents? What if you thought witches were Devil worshippers rather than simply nasty-minded neighbours? What if you regarded them as dangerous enemies of God? My video lecture looks at these big ideas of demonology and explores why some churchman and magistrates believed in it so fervently that they began mass witch trials. Professor Marion Gibson This week, we move from theory to practice, and will be looking at some examples of how suspected witches were tried in the 16th and 17th centuries. There were different trial procedures across all the different jurisdictions of Europe and North America, but well be focusing on a couple of these in England and in Massachusetts. First, well look at images of the famous Salem witch trials of 1692 and think about what it would have been like to have been questioned by magistrates and then sent to the Salem court. Well see how the legal officials altered standard court procedure and what effect that had. Then well look at other types of trial suspected witches might undergo, with images of the swimming test that was sometimes the precursor to a court room trial. What did people think they were doing when they swum a witchcraft suspect? How was that organised and what happened during and after this horrible public ordeal? Professor Marion Gibson This week we explore the legacy, or afterlife, of witch trials in contemporary culture. Stories about witches and witch trials often feature in modern films and TV shows, on social media and in the press. The idea of the witch remains as relevant as ever, despite many changes in the concept and its meaning. While in some places people are routinely tried as witches, and witchcraft is represented as a real threat, elsewhere the witch has been reimagined as a figure of fantasy, empowerment or glamour. Meanwhile, the idea of the witch hunt has become a shorthand phrase in western societies suggesting unjust persecution. For women and girls in these societies, witches are often seen as symbols of freedom and power. They are linked with the feminism of the 20th and 21st centuries, which brought greater acceptance of womens potential in the workplace, and in cultural and political life. Reclaiming the witch in this context meant rejecting images of sin and criminality associated with her and replacing them with ideas of fulfilment and agency. For other people, too, this empowered witch is attractive witches are associated with modern religious movements such as Wicca. Sign up to receive our newsletter!

A political philosophy that emerged in the early 20th century has challenged the idea that a person can be a true supporter of socialism from the comfort of their middle-class lives The term champagne socialist, often used pejoratively, refers to the perceived hypocrisy of liberal middle-class people who advocate for socialist ideals while continuing to enjoy their own affluent lifestyles. Since its conception more than a century ago, champagne socialism has been an enduring, if unofficial, part of politics in Britain and around the world. The pharse champagne socialist first appeared in the 1906 novel Blind Alleys by the American author George Cary Eggleston, in which one of the characters contrasts the so-called beer socialist  referencing the preferred beverage of the working class  to the champagne socialist in the middle class. This, Eggleston elucidates, is someone who wants everybody to be equal upon the higher plane that suits him, utterly ignoring the fact that there is not enough champagne, green turtle and truffles to go round. The novel sought to emphasise the gulf between the comfort of bourgeois life and the everyday hardships faced by the working class. The beer socialist is someone who wants everybody to come down to his low standards of living. Egglestone questioned the sincerity of those who, despite their privilege, champion economic and social equality. It could be expected that any accusations of hypocrisy when it comes to middle-class socialism would be coming chiefly from the political right. Yet some of the most vociferous attacks of champagne socialism have emanated from left-wing voices. A notable example is Ramsay MacDonald, the first Labour prime minister of the United Kingdom. He would be called a traitor to his partys egalitarian principles throughout his time in office, with critics lambasting his hobnobbing with the British elite. In 1931, with the economy reeling from the aftershocks of the Wall Street Crash two years earlier and the subsequent Great Depression, MacDonald formed the National Government. This was a coalition of the major political parties, but dominated by the Conservatives, so was immediately seen by many on the left as a betrayal of the organised labour movement. MacDonald was even expelled from his own party. More recently, supporters of New Labour  led by Tony Blair in the 1990s and 2000s  faced similar accusations. Critics of Blair, Gordon Brown and their allies pointed to their middle-class backgrounds, their courting of the Cool Britannia campaign a pop-culture-heavy celebration of all things British, and their perceived compromises on traditional Labour values, as the embodiment of champagne socialism. Variations of champagne socialism have existed in many nations around the world. In the 1980s, the term gauche caviar left caviar became particularly popular in France as an attack on their president François Mitterrand, for what his political enemies saw as his duplicity. In New Zealand and Australia, the preferred insult was for a time chardonnay socialist. But the implicit meaning of such insults has been expanded beyond socialism to expose hypocrisy among all progressive strains of thought. So in the United States, for example, one of the equivalent terms became limousine liberal. Other caricatures have emerged, from experts in their ivory towers to the luvvies of the metropolitan liberal elite. All have come to disparage a social caste regarded as being at the top of society who make vaguely egalitarian signals from their life of luxury inside gated communities, far removed from the experiences of ordinary people. Opponents of socialism have long relished pointing out that certain individuals on the left have enjoyed comfortable lives. Friedrich Engels  friend and sponsor of Karl Marx, and co-author of The Communist Manifesto  came from a wealthy family that owned factories, after all. Nevertheless, the label has occasionally been embraced by those on the left who reject the notion that socialism should aspire to a minimalist and austere existence. Returning to Blind Alleys, why should they give up the green turtle and truffles? Rather, they point out that their egalitarian beliefs stem from a desire to ensure that everybody is able to enjoy the finer things in life.
